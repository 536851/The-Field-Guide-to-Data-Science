Feature Engineering
===================

<I>Feature engineering is a lot like oxygen. You can’t do without it, but you rarely give it much thought.</I>

Feature engineering is the process by which one establishes the representation of data in the context of an analytic approach. It is the foundational skill in Data Science. Without feature engineering, it would not be possible to understand and represent the world through a mathematical model. Feature engineering is a challenging art. Like other arts, it is a creative process that manifests uniquely in each Data Scientist. It will be influenced substantially by the scientist’s experiences, tastes and understanding of the field. <br>

As the name suggests, feature engineering can be a complex task that may involve chaining and testing different approaches. Features may be simple such as “bag of words,” a popular technique in the text processing domain, or complex activities such as machine learning. You make use of the output of one analytic technique to create the representation that is consumed by another. More often than not, you will find yourself operating in the world of highly complex activities.
