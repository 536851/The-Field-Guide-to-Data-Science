The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science
===============================

 We cannot capture all that is Data Science. Nor can we keep up - the pace at which this field progresses outdates work as fast as it is produced. As a result, we have opened this field guide to the world as a living document to bend and grow with the community, technology, expertise, and evolving techniques. Therefore, if you find the guide to be useful, neat, or even lacking, then we encourage you to add your expertise, including:  

-	Case studies from which you have learned   
-	Citations for journal articles or papers that inspire you  
-	Algorithms and techniques that you love  
-	Your thoughts and comments on other peopleâ€™s additions  

Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.
