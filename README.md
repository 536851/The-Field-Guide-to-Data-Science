The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science
===============================

We cannot capture all that is Data Science. The pace at which this field progresses outdates work as fast as it is produced. We have opened up this field guide as a living document to bend and grow with technology, expertise, and evolving techniques. Therefore, if you find the guide to be useful, neat, or even lacking, then we encourage you to add your expertise, including:  

-	Case studies from which you have learned   
-	Citations for journal articles or papers that inspire you  
-	Algorithms and techniques that you love
