|	Agent Based Simulation	|	Simulates the actions and interactions of autonomous agents.	|	In many systems, complex behavior results from surprisingly simple rules. Keep the logic of your agents simple and gradually build in sophistication.	|	Macal, Charles, and Michael North. Agent-based Modeling and Simulation. Winter Simulation Conference. Dec. 2009. Print.	|
|	Collaborative Filtering	|	Also known as 'Recommendation,' suggest or eliminate items from a set by comparing a history of actions against items performed by users. Finds similar items based on who used them or similar users based on the items they use.	|	Use Singular Value Decomposition based Recommendation for cases where there are latent factors in your domain, e.g., genres in movies.	|	Owen, Sean, Robin Anil, Ted Dunning, and Ellen Friedman.

|	Coordinate Transformation	|	Provides a different perspective on data.	|	Changing the coordinate system for data, for example, using polar or cylindrical coordinates, may more readily highlight key structure in the data. A key step in coordinate transformations is to appreciate multidimensionality and to systematically analyze subspaces of the data.	|	Abbott, Edwin. A. Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions.

|	Hidden Markov Models	|	Models sequential data by determining the discrete latent variables, but the observables may be continuous or discrete.	|	One of the most powerful properties of Hidden Markov Models is their ability to exhibit some degree of invariance to local warping (compression and stretching) of the time axis. However, a significant weakness of the Hidden Markov Model is the way in which it represents the distribution of times for which the system remains in a given state.	|	Bishop, Christopher M. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. New York: Springer, 2006. Print.	|
|	Hierarchical Clustering	|	Connectivity based clustering approach that sequentially builds bigger (agglomerative) or smaller (divisive) clusters in the data.	|	Provides views of clusters at multiple resolutions of closeness.

|	Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)	|	A method of sampling typically used in Bayesian models to estimate the joint distribution of parameters given the data. 	|	Problems that are intractable using analytic approaches can become tractable using MCMC, when even considering high-dimensional problems. The tractability is a result of using statistics on the underlying distributions of interest, namely, sampling with Monte Carlo and considering the stochastic sequential process of Markov Chains.	|	Andrieu, Christophe, Nando de Freitas, Amaud Doucet, and Michael I. Jordan. An Introduction to MCMC for Machine Learning. Machine Learning, 50.1 (January 2003): 5-43. Print.	|

|	Naâ€¢ve Bayes	|	Predicts classes following Bayes Theorem that states the probability of an outcome given a set of features is based on the probability of features given an outcome.	|	Assumes that all variables are independent, so it can have issues learning in the context of highly interdependent variables. This method generally underperforms all other methods. However, the model can be learned on a single pass of data using simple counts and therefore is useful in determining whether exploitable patterns exist in large data sets with minimal development time.	|	Ingersoll, Grant S., Thomas S. Morton, and Andrew L. Farris. Taming Text: How to Find, Organize, and Manipulate It. New Jersey: Manning, 2013. Print.	|
|	Neural Networks	|	Learns salient features in data by adjusting weights between nodes through a learning rule.	|	Training a neural network takes substantially longer than evaluating new data with an already trained network.

New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2008. Print.	|
|	Outlier Removal	|	Method for identifying and removing noise or artifacts from data.	|	Be cautious when removing outliers. Sometimes the most interesting behavior of a system is at times when there are aberrant data points.	|	Maimon, Oded, and Lior Rockach. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook: A Complete Guide for Practitioners and Researchers. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2005. Print.	|
|	Principal Components Analysis	|	Enables dimensionality reduction by identifying highly correlated dimensions.	|	Many large datasets contain correlations between dimensions; therefore part of the dataset is redundant. When analyzing the resulting principal components, rank order them by variance as this is the highest information view of your data. Use skree plots to infer the optimal number of components.	|	Wallisch, Pascal, Michael E. Lusignan, Marc D. Benayoun, Tanya I. Baker, Adam Seth Dickey, and Nicholas G. Hatsopoulos.

Series B (Methodological) 58.1 (1996): 267-288. Print.	|
|	Sensitivity Analysis	|	Involves testing individual parameters in an analytic or model and observing the magnitude of the effect.	|	Insensitive model parameters during an optimization are candidates for being set to constants. This reduces the dimensionality of optimization problems and provides an opportunity for speed up.	|	Saltelli, A., Marco Ratto, Terry Andres, Francesca Campolongo, Jessica Cariboni, Debora Gatelli, Michaela Saisana, and Stefano Tarantola. Global Sensitivity Analysis: the Primer. New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, 2008. Print.	|
|	Simulated Annealing	|	Named after a controlled cooling process in metallurgy, and by analogy using a changing temperature or annealing schedule to vary algorithmic convergence.	|	The standard annealing function allows for initial wide exploration of the parameter space followed by a narrower search. Depending on the search priority the annealing function can be modified to allow for longer explorative search at a high temperature.	|	Bertsimas, Dimitris, and John Tsitsiklis. Simulated Annealing. Statistical Science. 8.1 (1993): 10-15. Print.	|
|	Stepwise Regression	|	A method of variable selection and prediction. Akaike's information criterionÃŠAIC is used as the metric for selection. The resulting predictive model is based upon ordinary least squares, or a general linear model with parameter estimation via maximum likelihood.ÃŠ	|	Caution must be used when considering Stepwise Regression, as over fitting often occurs. To mitigate over fitting try to limit the number of free variables used.	|	Hocking, R. R. The Analysis and Selection of Variables in Linear Regression. Biometrics. 32.1 (March 1976): 1-49. Print. 	|

|	Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency	|	A statistic that measures the relative importance of a term from a corpus.	|	Typically used in text mining. Assuming a corpus of news articles, a term that is very frequent such as the will likely appear many times in many documents, having a low value. A term that is infrequent such as a personÃ•s last name that appears in a single article will have a higher TD IDF score.	|	Ingersoll, Grant S., Thomas S. Morton, and Andrew L. Farris.
